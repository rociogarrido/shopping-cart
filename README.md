# Shopping Cart 🛒 🛍️

I have built this project to learn how to build a ReactJS shopping cart with Typescript, Material UI, Styled Components and React-Query.

## Features

- Add and remove products from the floating cart.
- Increase or decrease the quantity of a product in the cart.

## Technologies

- ReactJS for templating/routing 📖

- TypeScript as type checking compiler 👮

- Create React App as boilerplate 📦

- Free open API for dummy data to the items in the shop.

- React-Query hooks is used for fetching the data from the API.

- Styled Components is used in combination with Material UI to customize the styles. 💅🏻

## To Do

- Unit tests, integration tests, and e2e testing.
- Node server for the API.
- Deployment to Heroku/Netlify.
